# Recognition of Handwriting Numbers

This project aims to recognize handwritten single-digit numbers using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
The user can draw a number from 0 to 9 on the canvas, and the program will attempt to 
recognize the drawn digit.
This project demonstrates how to implement a simple digit recognition system using the KNN algorithm in combination with Tkinter for the GUI and OpenCV for image processing.
run main.py  ,This will launch the GUI application, where you can draw single-digit numbers and click the "Recognition of the written number" button to see the program's prediction.
